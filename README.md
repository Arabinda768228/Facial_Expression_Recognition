# Facial_Expression_Recognition

Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is a computer vision project that aims to automatically identify human emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and neutrality by analyzing facial features in images or real-time video. The process typically involves using datasets like FER-2013, preprocessing the images by converting them to grayscale, resizing, and normalizing them, and then training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or using transfer learning with pre-trained models like VGG16 or ResNet. Python, along with libraries like TensorFlow/Keras and OpenCV, is commonly used for development. The trained model can be integrated into applications to detect emotions, making it useful in human-computer interaction, healthcare, and surveillance.
